<h1>The Best Movies According to Kelvin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>All About Who You Know</h3>
<p>I specifically enjoyed this movie because of the unconventional plot. <br /> It was pretty low budget but the film has an ebb and flow to it, I must've seen it countless times.</p>
<h3>Past Lives</h3>
<p>I saw this movie and I thought it was really great, great love story about how we may not end up with a person who we're really connected to, someone seemingly a soulmate. <br> However, we may still end up with someone we love. Very well written movie.</p>
<h3>Entergalactic</h3>
<p>This, is just a feel good animation, with a cliche but very acceptable storyline and modern/hip cultural references. It also has a really cool soundtrack, which I listen to occasionally on Spotify.</p>
