<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an enthusiatic, budding, work in progress aiming to be a successful software engineer and deliver great things to the world with my skills.</p>

<p>As a fan of travelling, culture and language, I also love to learn new languages and hope to visit a lot of countries in the world and explore other cultures</p>

<p>This course was made for me and I will remain keen on learning more and achieving seemingly unrealistic goals. The sky is my springboard.</p>
